# Predicting-Loan-Defaulters-using-Machine-Learning
Loan defaulter prediction represents a critical business need for minimizing financial risks present in lending operations. The research aims to build machine learning detection models for loan defaulters through solutions for the class imbalance problem. The research used three resampling techniques including Random Undersampling and SMOTE and ADASYN to handle class imbalance in defaulters and non-defaulters data from Kaggleâ€™s public database. Our study included models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost and Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC). The XGBoost model combined with ADASYNresampling under GridSearchCV delivered remarkable recall at 0.99 along with excellent precision levels which was identically to GBC. The performance of the two models was outstanding while we observed potential verfitting issue. The implementation of GridSearchCV on Logistic Regression with ADASYN generated deployable outcomes because it reached a precision value of 0.87 together with recall of 0.78 while maintaining a clear output interpretation.
